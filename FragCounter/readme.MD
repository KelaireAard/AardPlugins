Tallimos' IF2 Frag Counter for Aardwolf MUD
-------------------------------------------
This plugin is used during the Fragment section of Icefall 2. The blockers can use one command to count the number of fragments in their room and report back to the group.

<pre>
<b>tif</b>                  - counts the number of icefall 2 fragments currently in your room then displays how many along with your
                       current room. i.e. gt 3n 5
<b>tif report (channel)</b> - sets the channel in which you want to display the count
<b>tif report</b>           - displays which channel the user has chosen to display the count
</pre>

<b>PLEASE NOTE</b>: the user can also use iffrag and ifrag in place of tif.
